# Palette Knife

**palette knife** |ˈpælət naɪf|  
noun  
a flat, steel blade with a handle for mixing colors; named after the board on which an artist lays and mixes paints.

Palette Knife is a utility for composing technical color palettes. It grew from the author's appreciation for the precise and humane colorimetry of Ethan Schoonover's ubiquitous [Solarized] color scheme and from his desire to create a similarly crafted palette after his own visual identity.
